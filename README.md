Performance Analysis of RISC-V

This code receives a binary ROM of an Assembly code in the RISC-V architecture and performs performance analysis based on opcodes and cycle count per instruction. 
It calculates the sum of cycles and divides it by the cycle quantity, and finally prints out the instructions along with the corresponding cycle count for each instruction. 
It also prints out the total cycle count and the average CPI.
